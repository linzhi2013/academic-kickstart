abstract = "*Neodon*, genus of a short time evolutionary history, was reported to be diverged from its relatives in early stage of Pleistocene. Only 4 species were well documented in *Neodon* for a long period of time until last years when a systematic work described and added three new species, adjusted three species used to belong to *Lasiopodomys*, *Phaiomys*, *Microtus* to *Neodon* and removed one species (*Neodon juldaschi*) to genus *Blanfordimys*, leading to a total of eight species recorded in *Neodon*. To gain a better insight into the phylogeny and ecology of *Neodon*, we have systematically sampled *Neodon* species along the whole Hengduan and Himalayan Mountains in the last 20 years. In addition to morphological identification, we generated 1x - 15x whole genome sequencing (WGS) data and achieved the mitochondrial genomes and an average of 5,382 nuclear genes for each morpho-species. Both morphology and phylogeny results supported an extra six new species in *Neodon* (nominated *Neodon shergylaensis sp. nov.*, *N. namchabarwaensis sp. nov.*, *N. liaoruii sp. nov., N. chayuensis sp. nov.*, *N. bomiensis sp. nov.*, and *N. bershulaensis sp. nov.*). This is the first study that included *Neodon* samples covering its entire distribution area in China and this systematic sampling also revealed a long-time underestimation of *Neodon*â€™s diversity, and suggested its speciation events linked highly to founder event via dispersal (from Plateau to surrounding mountains). The results also revealed that the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is the center of origin of *Neodon*, and the impetus of speciation include climate change, isolation of rivers and mountains.
