# Lepidoptera Community Assembly Project

## Mission

This project aims to use High-Throughput-Sequencing (HTS), compared with traditional Sanger-based DNA-Barcode method, to evaluate the community assembly.

I worked on this project on the behalf of BGI since 2014, supervised by Prof. Xin Zhou, Prof. Aibing Zhang, Dr. Shanlin Liu, and Dr. Min Tang.


● Pooling of individuals and DNA extraction, PCR

● Sanger sequences assembly

● SOAPBarcode assembly and compared with Sanger sequences

● Manuscript writing (partial)


The project has two papers, one is published on ***Molecular Ecology*** (https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.15412), another just got accepted by ***Evolutionary Ecology*** and will come out soon.
