# Lepidoptera Community Assembly Project

## Mission

This project aims to use High-Throughput-Sequencing (HTS), compared with traditional Sanger-based DNA-Barcode method, to evaluate the community assembly.

I worked on this project on the behalf of BGI since 2014, supervised by Prof. Xin Zhou, Prof. Aibing Zhang, Dr. Shanlin Liu, and Dr. Min Tang.
