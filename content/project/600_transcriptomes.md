# 600 Transcriptome Project

We aimed to sequence 600 arthropods to construct a transcriptome database and biobank for the southern hemisphere insects.

Supervised by Dr. Andreas Zwick, Prof. Xin Zhou, and Dr. Shanlin Liu, I was responsible for the following work on the behalf of BGI:

● Sample management

● Sequence data management

● Sequencing and assembly

● Transcriptome quality control

● PCR for DNA barcoding of 700 samples
