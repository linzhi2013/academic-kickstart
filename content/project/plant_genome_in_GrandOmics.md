# A plant genome and resequencing project

When I was in Beijing Grandomics Biosciences Co., Ltd (2019-2020), I engaged in a plant genome and resequencing project, in which I was responsible for the follwoing analysis:

● Homolog prediction

● Gene family expansion/contraction analysis

● Phylogeny inference

● Divergence times estimate

● Whole genome duplication (WGD) events analysis

● Genomic colinearity analysis

● Chloroplast assembly, annotation and phylogeny inference

● Manuscript writing (partial)

This manuscript is under review now.
