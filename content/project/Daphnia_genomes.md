# Two *Daphnia* Genomes Project

This project tries to construct the genomes of two *Daphnia* species with Roach-454-sequencing, Illumina Hiseq-sequencing, as well as Fosmid and BAC libraries.

Supervised by Dr. Jing Zhao, Dr. Shanlin Liu and Prof. Xin Zhou, I was responsible for the following analysis.

● Genome survey

● Genome assembly

● Assembly evaluation

● Genome annotation
