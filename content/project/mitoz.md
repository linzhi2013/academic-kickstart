# Development of MitoZ toolkit for mitochondrial genome analysis

We developed a mitochondrial genome toolkit, MitoZ, providing a one-click solution from HTS raw reads to genome assembly together with annotation and visualization outputs. MitoZ is programmed in Python3 with the assembly module of a modified version of SOAPdenovo-Trans, the annotation module of a Perl based script for protein coding genes (PCGs), MiTFi for tRNA and infernal-1.1.1 for rRNA (to see more, go to https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz173).

Supervised by Dr. Shanlin Liu, I was responsible for the following work:

● Study Design

● Programming implementation

● Data analysis

● Manuscript writing
